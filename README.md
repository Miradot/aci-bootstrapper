# Cisco ACI bootstrap

## Prerequisites
* Cisco ACI
* Ansible

## Use Case Description
The goal of this project is to help enginners bootstrap their newly set-up ACI installation according to Cisco best-practices. Note that itÂ´s possible to bootstrap more settings than included in these files (for example BGP RR, MCP, Switch Onboarding and so on and so forth). Contact Miradot for more information!

## Installation
```
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

## Usage
1) Populate `vars_files/main.yml` with any settings the engineer might want to override. The file already contains some examples of how to override the default settings. All settings found in `roles/bootstrap/defaults/main.yml` can be overriden in the same fashion.

2) Populate `hosts.ini` with the IP of the ACI controller.

3) Populate `group_vars/aci/vault.yml` with username and password. Also recommeded is to encrypt the file with Ansible vault `ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/aci/vault.yml`

4) Run the playbook `ansible-playbook main.yml -i hosts.ini`

### Example of main.yml to run the boostrap role

```yaml
# Content of main.yml, this is how the playbook running the bootstrap should look like.
---
- name: Bootstrap ACI
  gather_facts: no
  hosts: aci
  connection: local
  vars_files:
    - ./vars_files/main.yml

  tasks:
    - ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: bootstrap
...
```
